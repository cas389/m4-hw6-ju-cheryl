Assignment 6 for MMC6278 class.

## Issues While Completing Assignment
The biggest issue I had was with the toppings. It took me days to figure out how to do this. I knew I had to do a if/else statement based off of the teachers hints, but couldn't figure out how to get it to work with the for loop. I also had an issue (after I thought I was finished) where it gave an error after the user pressed the "cancel" button on toppings, instead of leaving it blank and pressing okay. I eventually gave it a few days until it hit me, and an else if statement to correct the issue, and it worked!

## Outside Resources
I had help from the professor on a few of the issues I was having. Lastly, I asked a question about the toppings on Stackoverflow.com as I was really stuck. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71040089/user-prompt-array-question-for-javascript/71040426#71040426 Using suggestions from there, I was able to fix an issue with my coding and tried the if / else statement again, which ultimately led for my coding to work.
